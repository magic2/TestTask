TestTask
========

One of test tasks I did when had last job seeking session

---------------

This is a simple console application which was intended to calculate words in input file 
and display results in output file (both input/output paths are command line arguments).
Output file contains of unique words takend from input file sorted descendingly by number of entries, 
each line format is: [word], [number of entries in input file].

The comparison is case insensitive.

Sample data is 7zipped in Data directory.
